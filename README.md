## üéØ The Problem

For many people, managing personal finances feels overwhelming. It's difficult to get a clear picture of your financial standing, and even harder to make strategic decisions, like figuring out the best time to pay a credit card bill to minimize interest charges. This lack of clarity can lead to stress and missed opportunities to save money.

## ‚ú® The Solution

**TEMBA** is a financial literacy dashboard that demystifies personal finance. It provides users with a centralized view of their accounts and includes a powerful calculator to determine the optimal payment dates for loans and credit cards. By turning complex financial data into actionable insights, TEMBA helps users build financial confidence and save money.
